Legal Document Analysis and Classification Using NLP
This project focuses on analyzing and classifying legal documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It demonstrates how machine learning models can be applied to understand, process, and categorize legal texts automatically, reducing manual workload and improving efficiency in legal tech applications.

üìÇ Project Structure
Legal Document Analysis and Classification Using NLP.ipynb:
The main Jupyter notebook containing the step-by-step implementation.

üìà How to Run
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Legal-Document-Analysis-NLP.git
cd Legal-Document-Analysis-NLP
Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If no requirements.txt yet, install manually: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, spacy, matplotlib, seaborn)

Run the notebook: Open Legal Document Analysis and Classification Using NLP.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Follow along the notebook and execute cells sequentially.

üìä Example Outputs
Successfully classified legal documents into different categories such as contracts, agreements, policies, etc.

Model evaluation metrics with high accuracy and meaningful insights from the legal text data.

üõ† Future Improvements
Implement deep learning approaches like BERT for better contextual understanding

Deploy a web-based application for document upload and classification

Add OCR support for scanned documents

Multi-label classification for documents belonging to multiple categories
